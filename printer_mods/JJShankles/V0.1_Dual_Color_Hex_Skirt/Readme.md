# Voron V0.1 dual color skirt

I liked the skirt idea from [Zen3D](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/Zen3D/V0_Skirt), but the V0.1 updated legs are taller so the old models won't work. I added the angles to the new V0.1 skirts.

I changed filament color at line 3 to get the dual color look.

I also created a version that can be used to add your Serial Number. I'll add a picture later when I get my serial number.
